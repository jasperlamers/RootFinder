# RootFinder by Jasper Lamers

Here is a script to trace roots of Arabidopsis thaliana grown on solid media plates (e.g. 1/2MS). 
Currently the script is working on colored images scanned with an Epson V600.

Place the script in the folder with the images and run it. First it creates 8bit grayscale images and .rsml files are added after analysis.
Tracing is not perfect, but manual curation is recommended with other root tracing programs like SmartRoot (https://smartroot.github.io 2011 Lobet et al. Plant Physiology, Vol. 157)
